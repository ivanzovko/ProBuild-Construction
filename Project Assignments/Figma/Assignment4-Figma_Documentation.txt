In this assignment me and my coworker took up on designing the visual display of the app for the user.
We took up the white-yellow colors that we decided upon 2 months ago and they seem to look good.
We avoided too much similarity with Njuskalo.hr and yet it looks kind of familiar and intuitive design.
We put the instructions all in one place so the potential client doesn't have to hustle going
through a 7 step click session in order to understand what the project is about.
It also seems intuitive enough for all the customers, as all you need to do is scroll down.
We will still see how the design will bare in real time environment.
