First user is the investor, Marko. He wants centrilized, digitalized way of tracking his portfolio.
He is a big fan of having everything at one place on his phone and values simplicity over everything.
Second user is the high network individual Anna that wants everything done swiftly and luxuriously.
She will not hesitate to pay top dollar for quality service and desires to have remote access to project reports at all times.
Third persona is Stipe. A family man from Dalmatinska Zagora he studied the topic the most. 
He wants to make use of his money and wants to pick the offer that gets him the most for his budget.
He is cautious of scammers and wants to avoid slow workers and slackers on his project.

These personas were created by examining a large pool of personas that we gathered.
Most of them taken by talking to various leaders of construction sites, 
one of them being Petar(co-founder of ProBuild-Construction) sister, as well as people working at local administration offices.

In the document we also provided a Sitemap and Card sorting for personas which we hope will enable us
easier realization of the project.
