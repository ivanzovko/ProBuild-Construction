Assignment 1: Idea Pitch

Project name:  PRO-BUILD CONSTRUCTION

Motivation:
We started by discussing the potential products and realisable ideas.
After some time, we remembered that during one lecture professor ÄŒagalj spoke about constructions. 
We both remembered how time and nerve consuming searching for the right construction crew is. (And often ridicilously expensive)
That's why we decided to launch PRO-BUILD CONSTRUCTION. 

Core ideas of the project:
- have construction companies registered with approximate prices and avaiable dates. Customer then filters companies that he doesn't like and requests an offer
- the company sends the customer a proposed offer based on some basic info he/she provides
- use predominantly yellow color to associate people with construction. Also reinforce the similarity to already popular site https://www.njuskalo.hr/ 

Problems to avoid:
- avoid the potential scamming problems the site https://www.emajstor.hr/ has by adding authentication systems for companies 
- avoid fake reviews by asking customers to provide receipts of the construction works before posting a review

Things that still have to be decided upon:
- will the customers and companies have seperate log-in forms?
- will there be a third admin login form that will recieve incoming verification requests?
- will we add distance as a metric for companies to decide their initial offer from the get-go?
- will we add payment options on the website or will they be only for connecting companies with the customer?
